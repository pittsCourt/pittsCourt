Software QA Engineer @ DigiCert | I build test automation with Go & Playwright, wrangle Kubernetes with Rancher/k9s, and write tooling in JavaScript/TypeScript. I’ve worked on data validation tools using APIs, and love making tests that actually catch things. Currently learning Python & cybersecurity (CompTIA Sec+). Always building, always curious.
